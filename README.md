Medical Booking System
A website for managing online booking for both patients and doctors

Product Overview
Introduction
Currently, internet makes our life more convenient. People can chat and shop online. Hence, we decided to design a medical online booking system. This booking system is designed for the patients who want to see a doctor and doctors. This system can help patients to make a booking online, which means that they do not need to wait doctors at hospital.  They just need to booking their appointment online. They can select exact date they want to go, the doctor they want to see and the hospital they want to go through this system. Also, patients can describe their situation to doctor by this system. As a doctor, if you receive a booking message from a patient, you can decide whether you will see this patient by confirmation or rejection. This system will save both patients’ and doctors’ time.
